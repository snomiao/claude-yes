## When to Use Which Image?

### Use Mini Image When:
- You only need agent-yes CLI
- You want fast pod creation (~10-30s vs 2-5min)
- You're on bandwidth/storage constrained environments
- You'll install additional tools on-demand

### Use Full Image When:
- You need all AI agent CLIs immediately available
- You're building projects that require compilation (Rust/C++)
- You want a complete development environment
- Network bandwidth/download time isn't a concern

## Installing Additional Tools

If you're using the mini image and need additional tools, see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for installation commands.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are typically required:

```bash
# For Claude Code
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# For other agents (if installed)
QWEN_API_KEY=your-key-here
GROQ_API_KEY=your-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Current Environment

To check which image you're running:

```bash
# Check image size
docker images snomiao/agent-yes

# Check available agents
which claude-code qwen-code grok gemini codex copilot auggie opencode 2>/dev/null || echo "Mini image - no agents pre-installed"

# Check if Rust is installed
rustc --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Rust not installed (mini image)"
```
